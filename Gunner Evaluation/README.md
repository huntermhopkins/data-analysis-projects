# Business Case
Despite being some of the most important players on the roster, there are currently no publicly available stats for NFL gunners. Being able to evaluate these players at  a quick glance could help add important context to their contributions to their team.

Scott Pioli, an NFL Media Analyst said, "The final 5-10 spots on the roster are often made up of players who are core special teams contibuters." Not only could data help inform coaches and front offices who take up those final spots, but also how much money they should earn.

The NFL uses [Next Gen Stats](https://operations.nfl.com/gameday/technology/nfl-next-gen-stats/) to track ball and player movement during each play. How teams leverage this to assess their players?
