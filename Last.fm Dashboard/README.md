## Business Case
While the music I listen to won't help business decisions, visualizing the trends of real-time data can. A dashboard pulls in a company's real-time data to present performance measures, recent trends, and other important data to the user. Decision makers can view all of this data at a quick glance and make more informed decisions based on it.

If me listening to music was a business, what data would decision makers and stakeholders want to be able to look at in an organized fashion on demand? They may want to know how frequently I am listening to music, or what time I'm listening to music. Maybe the genres of music I listen to or my top most listened artists, songs, and tracks would be useful. They would also want to be able to compare this data between different time periods.

Thinking of the music I listen to as a business might seem like a silly analogy, so what if this was data more pertinent to a company? Instead of tracking the amount of songs I listened to in a certain time period, a company's sales could be tracked. Instead of the top genres of a time period, the top product categories could be displayed. The number of songs I listen to each hour of the day could be replaced by how frequently a website is visited each hour, or how many calls the customer service line received. 

[Last.fm](https://www.last.fm) is a music website that tracks a user's listening history to recommend new music. Through their [API](https://www.last.fm/api), I can fetch my listening history in real time. This project utilizes Last.fm's API to make a dashboard visualizing trends and "performance measures" of my listening habits. KPIs such as listening frequency, top artists, top albums, top tracks, and top tags (genres) are displayed in the dashboard to be compared between multiple time periods.
